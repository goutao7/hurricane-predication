# Hurricane Path Prediction Using Linear Regression

A hurricane is a storm that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, their effect on human is often devastating. Every year during the season of the hurricane, many places are affected by it. But, if we somehow predict the hurricane that may occur in the specific region from the previous data, then we can take necessary steps. National Hurricane Center which is part of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - Government Agency)  conducts a post-storm analysis of each tropical cyclone in its area of responsibility to determine the official assessment of the cyclone’s history. This Analysis makes use of all available observations, including those that may not have been available in real time. This report is known as HURDAT database which contains all storm that appeared in 1851-2016. Each storm has data points from start to end in latitude and longitude format. That’s means if we plot this points in the graph will give you the path for the particular storm. We are trying to predict storm path if we found in any suspecting activity in the ocean and our program will give a list of points where the storm can occur.
